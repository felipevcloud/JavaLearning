# JavaLearning
A structured collection of Java challenges completed throughout a full-stack Java course. This repository documents my learning journey from fundamentals to advanced topics, including OOP, collections, lambdas, streams, databases, Spring Boot, and more. Each challenge represents a step in building problem-solving skills and clean coding habits.

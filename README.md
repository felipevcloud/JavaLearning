# Java Challenges Repository

This repository is my personal Java learning log.

It contains all challenges from a comprehensive Java course, organized by module and topic. The purpose is not only to complete exercises, but to reinforce concepts, document progress, and build strong problem-solving and clean coding habits.

## Progress

Current progress: up to **"Day of the Week Challenge - Solution"**, with more coming.

## Topics Covered

## Goal

This repository serves as:

- A record of my learning journey
- A structured practice archive
